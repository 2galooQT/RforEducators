# R for Educators

We would like to share these resources with you:
 
1. The recording from the live workshop is a is available on [CAC’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVPGMVWhp3sqWZFU5NntjTA/).

2. The workshop materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cornellcac/r_for_edu/) and [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/4044219). The `.Rmd` files are R notebooks with text explanations for the demos and hands-on portion of the workshop. You can use them with the workshop recordings or as self-paced tutorials.

    - The “Intro to R” (operators, functions, data types, data structures) is in `20_minutes_to_R.Rmd`
    - The regression portion is in `data-analysis-xsede-20220526.Rmd`
    - We included a supplement demo showing how to use a few of the tidyverse packages to inspect a CSV file in `examining_data.Rmd`

3. We prepared some supplemental materials, which are available as PDF files on GitHub:
    - `setup_cloud_demo.pdf` describes how we created and set up the RStudio cloud project we used in the workshop. RStudio Cloud requires minimal setup for workshop participants and can be a good way to start using and evaluating R. 
    - `resource_sheet.pdf` includes links to resources we mentioned in the talk and a few additional resources (including two free ebooks about R and some examples of how R can be incorporated in teaching).
    - `R_for_educators_slides.pdf` is the slides from the workshop.
 
4. The Cornell Virtual Workshop offers free, self-paced lessons covering a range of topics. Our R topic complements the material we covered in the webinar and addresses using R on multiple cores and on supercomputer infrastructure. The CVW R topic is available at https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/R/
